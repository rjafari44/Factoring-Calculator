# Polynomial Tools

#### Simple project which consists of multiple polynomial and related calculators. I ran this script with octave, but it will fully work with MATLAB

### How to run

For the Factoring calculator, ensure you are putting it in a format with brackets []. With the bracket in place, the numbers can either be separated with a comma, whitespace, both, or new line.

For the distributing calculator, the formatting is picky, ensure you are explicitly writing a '*' for each multiplication, other wise it will give a syntax error. For any other symbol, be explicit.

For the linear graphing calculator, the formatting is picky, ensure you are explicitly writing a '*' for each multiplication, other wise it will give a syntax error. For any other symbol, be explicit.

### Running the script inside Octave Shell

#### 1. Install the required symbolic package
